# Function_Transform

Data transformations are techniques used to modify the distribution or scale of data to improve model performance or meet assumptions of statistical models. Below are details about Function Transformer, Log Transform, Reciprocal Transform, and Square Root Transform.

1. Function Transformer
The FunctionTransformer in scikit-learn allows you to apply a custom transformation function to your data, either during preprocessing or as part of a pipeline.

Use Case

Standardize a dataset using any user-defined function.
Combine custom transformations into a machine learning pipeline.

2. Log Transform
The log transformation compresses large values while expanding smaller ones. It is especially useful for skewed data or data with exponential growth.
Use Cases

Reducing skewness in data.
Handling exponential trends.
Stabilizing variance.

3. Reciprocal Transform
The reciprocal transformation is the inverse of the data. It reduces large values significantly and increases smaller values.

Use Cases

Handling hyperbolic relationships.
Compressing large ranges of data.

4. Square Root Transform
The square root transformation reduces the impact of large values while preserving the data's structure. It's less aggressive than the log transformation.

Use Cases

Reducing skewness for moderately skewed data.
Stabilizing variance for count data.
